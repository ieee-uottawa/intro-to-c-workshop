```
Hello World!
```
---

## Question 2 – User Input (Integer)

Create a program which:

1. Asks the user to input an integer.
2. Prints the integer back to the screen.

---

## Question 3 – Area of a Circle

Create a program which:

1. Defines a float `p` as the value of π (PI) to **3 decimal places**.
2. Asks the user to input a radius.
3. Calculates the area of the circle.
4. Prints the result to **3 decimal places**.

Formula for the area of a circle:

```
Area = p * r²
```

* **Loops**
* **Strings**

---

## Question 6 – Pointers Only

Create a program which prints the integer:

```
10
```

You must use **only pointers and addresses** to accomplish this.

(No direct printing of the number is allowed.)

---

## Question 7 – Functions and Pointers

Create a program which:

1. Starts with a value of `20`.
2. Uses a `void` function named `divide_by_10`.
3. Divides the value by 10 using **pointers and addresses**.
4. Prints the value **before** and **after** the division.

Function prototype:

```c
void divide_by_10(float *value);
```

## Question 8 – Structures

Create a structure that allows tracking employees in a company with:

* Name
* Employee ID
* Department
* Salary

Then print each employee’s:

* Employee ID
* Department
* Salary
