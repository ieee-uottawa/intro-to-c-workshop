/*
***** Question 9 - Dynamic Memory Allocation *****

Create a program which:

1. Asks the user how many integers they want to store.
2. Dynamically allocates enough memory to store that many integers using `malloc`.
3. Uses a loop to let the user input each integer.
4. Prints all the integers back to the screen.
5. Frees the allocated memory using `free`.

Rules:

* You must use `malloc` to allocate the array.
* You must check that `malloc` was successful.
* You must use `free` before the program exits.

Example run:

How many numbers do you want to store? 4
Enter number 1: 10
Enter number 2: 25
Enter number 3: 7
Enter number 4: 42

You entered:
10
25
7
42
